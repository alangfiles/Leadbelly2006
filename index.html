      <p>Cory Matthews, after leaving high school and saying goodbye to his mentor Mr. Fenny, he changed his name to Craig something, and starting playing ultimate at OSU. BMW has a playing style that is reminescient of all the lessons he's learned, and his style is highly influenced by his rouge friend Shaun. He now enjoys under the leg passes and hitting the rock.</p>
